Steps to run the project :

Run your json-server first which will run on http://localhost:3000

Then open the React JS app and run npm install / yarn install in root folder.

Once you install the dependencies run the app using npm start.

If there are any issues in running the application, kindly delete all node modules & then try reinstalling all the node modules.

I've developed the app for Desktop Site only as it was just a demonstration of React JS knowledge.

I've taken less data to display in columns so that it doesnt take more time to submit the test. Other data can be taken & displayed depeneding on the business logic of the company which wont be difficult.


Have a great Day...
